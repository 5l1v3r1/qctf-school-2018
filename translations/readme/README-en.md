This is the repository for the development of QCTF School 2018 competitions - full-time CTF competitions for schoolchildren held by the team [HackerDom](http://hackerdom.ru). The competition was held on May 13, 2018 at the [26 venues](http://qctf.ru/school-2018/places).

More than 150 teams took part in the competition (each - up to four people).

There are tasks in the tasks folder. Each task is in its own folder.
The basis for the verification system was the system [flag](https://github.com/andgein/drapo), developed by Andrew Hein.
